- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Docker:** For containerizing the application for easier deployment.

## Installation
To run the Game Recommendation System locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- Alternatively, install Python 3.12 and required packages if you prefer running the application directly.

### Steps

   ```

3. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 game-recommendation-system
   ```

4. Access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

2. Input your preferences in the provided fields.
3. Click on the "Get Recommendations" button to see personalized game suggestions.
4. Explore the visualizations and statistics for insights on various games.

## How It Works
The Game Recommendation System utilizes two main approaches to generate game recommendations:
- **Collaborative Filtering:** This technique uses user behavior and preferences to recommend games that similar users enjoyed.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** This approach recommends games based on their features and attributes that match the user's interests.

The system combines both methods to provide a robust recommendation list.
